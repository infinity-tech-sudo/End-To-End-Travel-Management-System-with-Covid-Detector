## INTRODUCTION

I have tried my best to make the complicated process of Online Hotel Management System as simple as possible using Structured & Modular technique & Menu oriented interface. I have tried to design the software in such a way that user may not have any difficulty in using this package & further expansion is possible without much effort. Even though I cannot claim that this work to be entirely exhaustive, the main purpose of my exercise is perform each Employee’s activity in computerized way rather than manually which is time consuming.

####

I am confident that this software package can be readily used by non-programmingpersonal avoiding human handled chance of error. This project is used by two types of users.
####
i.	Online Users.
ii.	Administrator (management of the Hotel). Online users can see the required articles or news
####
Administrator can maintain daily updates in the hotel records. Administrator is must be an authorized user. He can further change the password. There is the facility for passwordrecovery, logout etc.
The main aim of the entire activity is to automate the process of day to day activities of Hotel like Room activities, Admission of a New Customer, Assign a room according to customer’s demand, checkout of a computer and releasing the room etc.
####
The limited time and resources have restricted us to incorporate, in this project, only a main activities that are performed in a HOTEL Management System, but utmost care has been taken to make the system efficient and user friendly.
####
 “HOTEL Management System” has been designed to computerized the following functions that are performed by the system:
* Hotel Detail Functions
* Opening a Hotel
* Modification to Hotel assigned
* Check-in and check-out Detail Functions
* Admission of New customer
* Check-out of customer
* Room assigning related to customer’s need.
* Statement of Customer Details
* Check-in customer
* Check-out customer
* Room Details
* Individual customer Report

## Problem statement:-

 The project hotel management system is a web based application that allows the hotel manager(Admin Corner) to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various hotel bookings and rooms make this system very flexible and convenient. The hotel manager is a very busy person and does not have the time to sit and manage the entire activities manually on paper. This application gives him the power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online system. Hotel management project provides room booking, staff management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system. Customers can view and book room online. Admin has the power of either approving or disapproving the customer's booking request. Other hotel services can also be viewed by the customers and can book them too. 
The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to portably manage the hotel activities.

#### objective:-

During the past several decades personnel function has been transformed from a relatively obscure record keeping staff to central and top level management function. There are many factors that have influenced this transformation like technological advances, professionalism, and general recognition of human beings as most important resources.

* A computer based management system is designed to handle all the primary information required to calculate monthly statements. Separate database is maintained to handle all the details required for the correct statement calculation and generation.

* This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as record updation, maintenance, and searching.

* The searching of record has been made quite simple as all the details of the customer can be obtained by simply keying in the identification of that customer.

* Similarly, record maintenance and updation can also be accomplished by using the identification of the customer with all the details being automatically generated. These details are also being promptly automatically updated in the master file thus keeping the record absolutely up-to-date.

* The entire information has maintained in the database or Files and whoever wants to retrieve can’t retrieve, only authorization user can retrieve the necessary information which can be easily be accessible from the file.

* The main objective of the entire activity is to automate the process of day to day activities of Hotel like:

1.	Room activities,
2.	Admission of a New Customer,
3.	Assign a room according to customer’s demand,
4.	Checkout of a computer and releasing the room
5.	Advance online bookings.
6.	Online Cancellation.
7.	List of Regular customers.
8.	Email facility.
9.	Feedbacks
This project have some more features:

•	System Connectivity

•	No data duplication
•	No Paper Work Required

•	Time Efficient

•	Cost Efficient

•	Automatic data validation

•	User friendly environment

•	Data security and reliability

•	Fast data insertion & retrieval

•	Easy performance check
 ## Advantages:
* Sometimes it happens that the rooms get booked soon when one visits the place therefore user can make advance booking using this system.
 * It saves user time in search of rooms.
* The system is useful as it calculates an exact cost for requested number of days.
* It saves organization resources and expenses.
* This system is effective and saves time and cost of users.
* Easy registration
We are implementing a Web Service that will allow a user to :
  #### Login Page - 
    * Customer
    * Admin(Hotel Managers)
   #### Sign Up -
    * Customer
    * Admin(Hotel Managers)
 #### Log out -

* Customer
  * Admin(Hotel Manager)
 * Listing of Available Hotels 
 * Basic Listing of available hotels on a given day  
* Availability of Quarantine Center
* Availabilty of Monitoring System
* Booking of Hotels
* Cancelling the booking hotels if Customer want to cancel the booking  of hotels in the specific day
* After cancelling any booking hotels they can book hotel to follow same procedure on same day or another day as Customer wish.
* Customer can choice different hotels in 
 one place.
#### Forget Password:-
  If any customer forget their password in login time then they click forget password button and a new page open then when customer give their emailid ,their password is shown in our website.
#### Update hotels:-
Any Admin to enter our website by registered email id and password to add any new hotel or remove any hotel
#### Add Hotels
  * Admin(Hotel Managers)
####  Booking History
  * Admin(Hotel Managers)
#### Unique Advantage:-
 Any Customers who book hotels by our website frequently ,they have a unique advantage by our side.  
#### Feedback page:-
Customers have a feedback mail after check-out from hotels to give any feedback message to us ,they log in by their registered email and password.
* Before check-in time every customer has a mail and from our side also before check-out time ,they have a mail from our site because of reminder.
#### Admin login and admin dashboard: 
It has admin login who has the authority of the system and he is responsible for approving and disapproving the users request for room booking. Admin can add and delete notifications and updates in the system.
#### User Registration: 
There is user registration form available where new users can create their account by providing required information to the system.
#### Booking System: 
User can request for the table booking for a particular date and time.
#### Approving/Disapproving Request: 
The booking requests are directly sent 
with respective user details and therefore make decisions for cancelling the requests.
